# 🧩 GRC Engineering Lab – RiskHunter-labs

Welcome to the **GRC Engineering Lab**, a modular, PDCA-driven portfolio of real-world Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) implementations. Built by [Richard Dor](https://github.com/RiskHunter-labs) to blend security leadership with hands-on engineering.

> **Mission**: Codify controls. Automate evidence. Operationalize trust.

## 🧠 About the Lab

This lab is designed to **bridge the gap between security frameworks and engineering reality**.  
Each module in this repo follows a clear Plan–Do–Check–Act (PDCA) lifecycle and focuses on:

- 🧱 Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) security
- 🧾 Policy-as-Code (OPA/Rego)
- 🔄 CI/CD pipeline hardening
- ☁️ Cloud-native CSPM and IAM controls
- 📈 Compliance automation and dashboards
- 🤖 AI governance using ISO/IEC 42001

> This is my technical playground and professional proof-of-work. Every artifact here is real, usable, auditable, and defensible in front of an auditor or hiring panel.

## 🗂️ Module Layout

Each module is self-contained under `/modules`, and follows the same PDCA structure:

```
modules/
  00-env-bootstrap/
    PLAN.md        # Goals and setup
    DO/            # Code, scripts, IaC, policies
    CHECK.md       # Test results, scans, screenshots
    ACT.md         # Lessons learned, next steps
```

> Start with Layer 0 and follow the roadmap below to climb from foundational to AI-native GRC maturity.
